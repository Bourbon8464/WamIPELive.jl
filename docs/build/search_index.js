While aerobraking has been extensively validated at Mars and Venus through successful missions, this tool extends rigorous analysis capabilities to underexplored targets including Earth-return trajectories and Titan. This work addresses this gap with a systematic perturbation analysis of the aero-braking environment performed with the Julia Aerobraking Trajectory Simulator. The Julia Aerobraking Trajectory Simulator is a high-fidelity tool that couples the GRAM atmospheric suite with high-degree gravitational harmonics, third-body gravitational effects, and solar-radiation pressure.
